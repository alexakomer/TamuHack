# Password Timer

# This is my first ever TamuHack competition. Using my knowledge of Java and little else, my team made a keystroke timer as an added security measure. This timer worked to record someone typing in their password, and then added tolerances to their keystrokes when they type their password in again to determine if this was the same person or not.
